    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Crustburger is a delicious burger featuring a crispy, caramelized crust on the beef patty, topped with melted cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato, and your favorite condiments, all served on a toasted bun. The secret is in the seared crust that locks in flavor and juiciness.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20 recommended)</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape into patties, slightly larger than the buns. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet or heavy pan over high heat until very hot. Do not add oil.</li>
        <li>Place the patties in the skillet and press down gently. Cook without moving for 3-4 minutes, until a deep brown crust forms.</li>
        <li>Flip the patties, add a slice of cheese to each, and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the cheese melts and the burgers are cooked to your liking.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, butter the buns and toast them in a separate pan or under a broiler until golden.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers: place lettuce, tomato, and pickles on the bottom bun, add the crusted patty with cheese, and top with your favorite condiments and the top bun.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
